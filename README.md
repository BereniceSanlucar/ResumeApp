# ResumeApp

This app shows a person's Curriculum (with non-real data) from a JSON created and hosted at https://api.myjson.com//bins/jhwba

As an additional note, in Contact Information tab screen, every icon has a predetermined action: only in real devices the phone icon will show an alert with the number to call (if you select Call will open phone app), on the other hand for mail icon if you have a mail configured in your device then it will prompt mail native app with predetermined info to be send (sucha as a salutation, person's mail and subject) and finally the Linkedin icon once tapped will open Safari for the predetermined link.
